# 🚢 Ladice

> **"A legendary artifact from the pre-AI era."**

**Ladice** is a 2D arcade survival game where you navigate a boat through treacherous waters, dodging obstacles and enemies while trying to keep your score high.

This project holds a special place in history: it was **my very first game**, hand-coded in C++ during my high school years at **Vegova** (Electrotechnical-Computer Vocational School and Gymnasium Ljubljana).

Back then, there were no LLMs, no Copilot, just raw determination, `std::cout`, and a bunch of headbanging. Today, it has been dusted off, polished, and "imped" with the power of modern AI to run smoothly on Linux.

## 📜 History & Tech Stack

*   **Origin:** Vegova High School Project.
*   **Language:** C++ (Standard 17).
*   **Library:** SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) for graphics and audio.
*   **Refactoring:** In 2026, the codebase was modernized by **Antigravity** (an AI Agent). We fixed memory management, replaced the build system with `Make`, resolved renderer conflicts, and ensured Linux compatibility.
